Im trying to commit for my school assignment but I'm also very passionate about Github.

Me in AP Calculus AB and AP Physics 1: Algebra Based (Because physics totally isn't almost all calculus so maybe it would've been better for us to take Calc junior year so that we could take an actual physics class instead of an algebra based one where almost everything is related to calculus but the teacher can't explain the concepts in case some students haven't taken calculus which we havent but maybe its counter productive to have calculus and physics back-to-back since that would make it pretty hard to separate the two classes especially since they go hand in hand but we can't say they do because its algebra based)
